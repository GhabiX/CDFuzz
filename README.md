# Environment & Build-up

ESC servers with 128-core 2.6GHz AMD EPYCâ„¢ROME 7H12 CPUs and 256 GiB RAM. The machine runs on Linux 4.15.0-147-generic Ubuntu 18.04 with llvm-13.

## Env Setup & CDFuzz Compilation

```bash
# Install LLVM-13
wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
sudo chmod +x llvm.sh
sudo ./llvm.sh 13

# Compile the CDFuzz
cd ../path-to-repo/CDFuzz
export PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-13/bin:$PATH
make clean && make
cd llvm-mode
make clean && make
```

## Compile target program & Extract dictionary

```bash
cd ../path-to-repo/Demo/jhead
export PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-13/bin:$PATH
export CC=../path-to-repo/CDFuzz/afl-clang-fast
make clean && make

# Start Fuzzing
cd ../path-to-repo/Demo/fuzzing
../path-to-repo/CDFuzz/afl-fuzz -d -i ./jhead-initial-seed -o ./fuzz-out -x ../jhead/jhead_dict -e -- ../jhead/jhead @@
```
